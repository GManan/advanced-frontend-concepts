## ☝🏼The Point
This Project is supposed to be a base for anyone who played with css and gets frustrated.

I am showing best practices(i hope),when it comes to structuring,orgnising and maintaining  a fronent Project.Showing main pain points, like
- the classic **Centering a div**
- different teqniques of making **tables** on smaller screens bareble
- some **animations**
- a **small form**(not too exciting)

I laid the foundation and am hopping to have time and interrest to keep on improving and growing it.

...anyway. lets start: what is going on here?

# Guidlines 
This is uni project, so i will use the official requirment list to help find your way better around here.

## 📂 Project Structure & Conventions

This project follows the **ITCSS architecture** for organizing styles and the **BEM methology** for naming clases.

<details>
<summary>ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS)</summary>

Styles are orgnised using ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) method.
This splits styles into layers, going from generic to specific.

- **Settings** – variables, colors, fonts

- **Tools** – mixins, functions

- **Generic** – resets, normalize

- **Elements** – base HTML elements (h1, p, a)

- **Objects** – layout patterns (.o-page, .o-grid)

- **Components** – UI blocks (.c-tabs, .c-section)

- **Utilities** – helpers (.u-hidden, .u-text-center)

This layered structure avoids conflicts and keeps code scalable.

<details>
<summary> BEM (Block Element Modifier)
</summary>
Classes are named using the BEM convention

- **Block** →  sandalone entity (.tab-panel)
- **Element** → part of block (.tabs__tab)
- **Mofifier** → variation od blocck/element (.tabs__tab--active)

<details>
<summary> Combining ITCSS & BEM</summary>
To keep things clear, use prefixes:

- o → Objects (o-page,o-container)
- c → Components( c-section,c-tabs)
- u → Utilities (u-hidden)

It can sometimes get confusing, what goes where, so good luck...
